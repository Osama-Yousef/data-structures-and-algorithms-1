Given two Binary Search Trees, find common nodes in them.

## Challenge

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.
- Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

Input:

            left_tree              right_tree
            
            [A]                      [B]
           / | \                    / | \
         [B][C][D]                [E][F][G]
        / | \   | \
      [E][F][G][H][I]

Output (as set):

    (B, E, F, G)
