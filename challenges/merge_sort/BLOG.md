### Pseudocode

```pseudocode
ALGORITHM Mergesort(arr)
    DECLARE n <-- arr.length

    if n > 1
      DECLARE mid <-- n/2
      DECLARE left <-- arr[0...mid]
      DECLARE right <-- arr[mid...n]
      // sort the left side
      Mergesort(left)
      // sort the right side
      Mergesort(right)
      // merge the sorted left and right sides together
      Merge(left, right, arr)

ALGORITHM Merge(left, right, arr)
    DECLARE i <-- 0
    DECLARE j <-- 0
    DECLARE k <-- 0

    while i < left.length && j < right.length
        if left[i] <= right[j]
            arr[k] <-- left[i]
            i <-- i + 1
        else
            arr[k] <-- right[j]
            j <-- j + 1

        k <-- k + 1

    if i = left.length
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in right
    else
       set remaining entries in arr to remaining values in left
```

### Python3 Implementation

```python3
def merge_sort(arr):
    '''Takes in a list and sorts list in place'''
    n = len(arr)

    if n > 1:
        mid = n // 2
        left = arr[:mid]
        right = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)
        merge(left, right, arr)

def merge(left, right, arr):
    '''
    Functions as helper function for merge_sort(), doing the actual
    sorting.
    '''
    left_idx, right_idx, arr_idx = 0, 0, 0

    while left_idx < len(left) and right_idx < len(right):
        if left[left_idx] <= right[right_idx]:
            arr[arr_idx] = left[left_idx]
            left_idx += 1
        else:
            arr[arr_idx] = right[right_idx]
            right_idx += 1

        arr_idx += 1

    if left_idx == len(left):
        for item in right[right_idx:]:
            arr[arr_idx] = item
            arr_idx += 1
    else:
        for item in left[left_idx:]:
            arr[arr_idx] = item
            arr_idx += 1
```

## Trace

### Pass 1

![Pass 1](./assets/1stpass.jpg)

In the first pass we assign the value at array[1], the 2nd cell, and assign it to variable temp. We compare the value of array[0] which is 20 to the value of variable temp, which is 18. Since 20 is greater than 18 we shift the 20 to the right.

### Pass 2

![Pass 2](./assets/2ndpass.jpg)

In the second pass we remove the value at index 2 and store it in temp. temp = 12. We compare 12 to [1] 20, it's lower, and we then compare it to [0], 18, and it's also lower. temp value is assigned to [0].

### Pass 3

![Pass 3](./assets/3rdpass.jpg)

Here we assign the value of 8 to temp, compare it to 20, and because 8 is a lower value it shifts down all the way to index of 0.

### Pass 4

![Pass 4](./assets/4thpass.jpg)

In the fourth pass we assign 5 to the variable temp, comparing it to the value in the previous index, 20. Since 5 is less than 20, as well as all the others, it slides down to index of 0.

### Pass 5

![Pass 5](./assets/5thpass.jpg)

In this final pass we assign the value -2 to the variable temp, comparing it to the value in the previous element, 20. Since -2 is lower than all the previous values, it is assigned to index of 0. -->
