# Array Binary Search of 1D Array
Given a sorted array of numbers and a target value, return the index of the target value in the array. If it's not found return -1.

## Tests

TBD

## Challenge
Write a function called binary_search which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency
Set left and right bounds of array to left and right vars respectively.
Set mid_idx = (left + right) // 2. 
Compare val at mid_idx to target val.
If they're equal return mid_idx,
else if val @ mid > target, set right to mid, else set left to mid val.
Repeat until left == right. If target value not found, return -1.

time <- O(log n)
space <- O(log n)
